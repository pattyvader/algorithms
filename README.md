Overview
--------

This repository serves as a collection of algorithm implementations, showcasing the logic and steps of algorithms in different programming languages. Currently, you will find implementations of **Sorting Algorithms** such as Insertion Sort and Selection Sort. Each algorithm is implemented in both Python and JavaScript, providing a comparison between the two languages. More languages are welcome!

Folders Structure
-----------------

The repository is structured as follows:

```bash
algorithms/
├───insertion_sort/
│   ├───insertion_sort.py
│   └───insertion_sort.js
└───selection_sort/
    ├───selection_sort.py
    └───selection_sort.js
```
### Each folder contains:

*   **Python**: Implementation of the algorithm in Python.
    
*   **JavaScript**: Implementation of the algorithm in JavaScript.
    

Supported Algorithms
--------------------

Currently, the repository includes the following algorithms:

1.  **Insertion Sort** - A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
    
2.  **Selection Sort** - A comparison-based algorithm that selects the smallest element and swaps it into the correct position.
    

Usage
-----

You can explore the algorithms in this repository by navigating to the respective language folder. To run any of the algorithms:

### Python

1.  Navigate to the python/ folder inside the algorithm's directory.
    
2.  Run the Python script in your terminal or command line:

```bash
python insertion_sort.py
python selection_sort.py
```
    

### JavaScript

1.  Navigate to the javascript/ folder inside the algorithm's directory.
    
2.  Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:

```bash
node insertion_sort.js
node selection_sort.js
```
